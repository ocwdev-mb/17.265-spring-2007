Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Overview
---------------

Welcome to Public Opinion and American Democracy. This course will examine public opinion and assess its place in the American political system. The course will emphasize both how citizens' thinking about politics is shaped and the role of public opinion in political campaigns, elections, and government. While the course will focus on research on the current state of public opinion, throughout the course we will also discuss historical developments in opinion and its place in politics, including changes that arose with the development of polling and with the advent of television and other electronic media. We will also consider normative questions, including the role opinion **should** play in American democracy.

Requirements and Expectations
-----------------------------

You are expected to attend every class session. You are further expected to come prepared to discuss the issues raised in the {{% resource_link b017ebe4-7d8f-24c3-4978-6551b38d0798 "readings" %}}. Please read the assigned materials **before class** on the date they are listed.

To meet the purpose of the course, you will be expected to both consume and digest readings from scholarly and journalistic sources. You are also expected to be aware of current events, especially relating to American politics. I highly recommend that you subscribe to and read a national newspaper, such as the _Wall Street Journal_ or the _New York Times_.

Each week, one-half of the class will be required to write a short essay responding to the week's readings, no longer than two single-spaced pages. Students will also be required to write two papers for the class. More details about these papers can be found in {{% resource_link fdd90184-327d-b80e-c6ba-d4d51a60a48e "assignments" %}} .

I expect that all papers will be turned in **on time**: no exceptions; no excuses. In addition, plagiarism is entirely unacceptable. Should you turn in a plagiarized paper, appropriate University sanctions will be pursued. If you are unclear what constitutes plagiarism, please talk to me. Finally, grades for your paper will be based on both substance and style. The papers will be graded on the quality of thought and analysis, the research you do, and the quality of writing. Use proper grammar, appropriate language and (please, please, please) proofread and spell-check the final copy of you paper before turning it in.
